# Database Configuration

This document outlines the steps for configuring the MySQL database for the EduLens project. We assume that MySQL is already installed on your system. If not, refer to [prerequisites documentation](/getting-started/prerequisites#postgresql-setup).

- MySQL is installed and running on 3306 port. (default)

## Configuration Steps

### Create a New User

First, we need to create a new MySQL user. Execute the following SQL command in the MySQL command line interface (msql):

```sql
CREATE USER 'edulens'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your-beautiful-password';
```

### Create a New Database

Next, create a new database named edulens:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE edulens;
```

### Grant Privileges to the User

Grant the newly created user the necessary privileges on the edulens database:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON edulens.* TO 'edulens'@'localhost';
```

### Update Project Code

You need to update an '.env' file for our backend application under **apps/api**. `your-beautiful-password` needs to be hear. Also, we need to descibe some other environment
variables for MySQL. These values are required for the database connection.

```env
/* ... other keys */
DB_PASSWORD=your-beautiful-password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=edulens
DB_NAME=edulens
DB_SSL_MODE=false
```

Navigate to the apps/api/scripts directory in your project using the terminal. This scripts folder contains a setup-db.sh script for creating tables. The chmod +x command is used to make the script executable. Once the script is executable, you can run it directly.

```
chmod +x setup-db.sh
./setup-db.sh
```

Your MySQL database is now configured and ready for the EduLens project. You have created the necessary user, database, and tables, and updated your project code to handle table creation.

## Attendance Platform Database Design

This database design outlines the structure for an attendance platform. The design includes tables for schools, students, classes, attendance records, and teachers, with appropriate columns and constraints. The design aims to support multiple schools, each managing its own students, teachers, and attendance records efficiently.

### Classes

Represents classes.

| Column | Data Type  | Constraints | Description                                  |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| id     | CHAR(36)   | PRIMARY KEY | Unique identifier for the class (UUID).      |
| level  | INT        | NOT NULL    | Education level of the class (e.g., 11, 12). |
| branch | VARCHAR(2) | NOT NULL    | Branch identifier (e.g., A, B, C).           |

### Students

Represents the students.

| Column        | Data Type       | Constraints                          | Description                                         |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| id            | CHAR(36)        | PRIMARY KEY                          | Unique identifier for the student (UUID).           |
| class_id      | CHAR(36)        | NOT NULL                             | Foreign key referencing Classes(id).                |
| student_image | VARCHAR(255)    | NULL                                 | URL or file path for the student's profile picture. |
| school_number | BIGINT          | NOT NULL, UNIQUE                     | Unique school number assigned to the student.       |
| first_name    | VARCHAR(255)    | NOT NULL                             | First name for the student                          |
| last_name     | VARCHAR(255)    | NOT NULL                             | Last name for the student                           |
| created_at    | BIGINT UNSIGNED | NOT NULL, DEFAULT (UNIX_TIMESTAMP()) | Timestamp of when the student was created.          |

### Attendances

Represents a polling session for a particular class.

| Column     | Data Type       | Constraints                          | Description                                   |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| id         | CHAR(36)        | PRIMARY KEY                          | Unique identifier for the attendance (UUID).  |
| class_id   | CHAR(36)        | NOT NULL                             | Foreign key referencing Classes(id).          |
| created_at | BIGINT UNSIGNED | NOT NULL, DEFAULT (UNIX_TIMESTAMP()) | Timestamp of when the attendance was created. |

### Attendance Details

Represents students and their status in a polling session.

| Column        | Data Type | Constraints | Description                                   |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| id            | CHAR(36)  | PRIMARY KEY | Unique identifier for the attendance (UUID).  |
| attendance_id | CHAR(36)  | NOT NULL    | Foreign key referencing Attendances(id).      |
| student_id    | CHAR(36)  | NOT NULL    | Foreign key referencing Students(id).         |
| is_present    | BOOLEAN   | NOT NULL    | Whether the student was present (true/false). |
